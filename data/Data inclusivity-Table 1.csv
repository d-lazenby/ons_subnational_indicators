Notes on data included or excluded in the Subnational indicators explorer,,,,
,,,,
"All data included in this first iteration of the Subnational indicators explorer come from data sources which are already available to the public. All effort has been made to ensure that the data is as inclusive as possible within the delivery timescales. Some available data sources produced by the Devolved Administrations have not been included in this first iteration to mitigate the risk of incorrect comparisons across data sources which are not methodologically coherent. In this cases, only data for England have been included. For future iterations of the explorer, we will be working with colleagues in the devolved administrations to improve the comparability of indicators at UK level where possible, while acknowledging the devolved nature of some policy areas. 
The information presented in this tab details what data have been excluded and why for each indicator.",,,,
